Project Introduction

In today's competitive job market, recruiters receive a massive number of resumes for each job opening, making the screening process time-consuming and inefficient. This project aims to automate resume screening using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve efficiency and accuracy in candidate selection. The system extracts key information from resumes, ranks candidates based on job relevance, and minimizes bias by leveraging advanced AI models. By automating resume filtering, this project helps recruiters make faster, data-driven hiring decisions while ensuring fair and efficient shortlisting of candidates.
